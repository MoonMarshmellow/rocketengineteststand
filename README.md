**Project Files for the Engine Test Stand seen on YouTube**

Anyone can use or modify these files in whichever way they want.

The test stand is designed for 35mm diameter rocket engines, although cases for narrower ones can be designed and printed fairly easily.

**WARNING FOR THE CODE**

The countdown starts as soon as the code is loaded so make sure that whatever device is logging data has the serial monitor open. Make sure that once power is supplied to the Arduino you are ready for the countdown to begin. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.

**LEGAL NOTICE**

I am not responsible for any use or misuse of the files and code contained within here. This is not a perfect solution and I don't intend it to be taken as one. Please do your own research before trying to build something like this.
